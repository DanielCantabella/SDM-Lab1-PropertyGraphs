This work investigates the use of various nanoparticles for biosensing based on LSPR. 
 
Triangular silver nanoplates (TSNPs), synthesized using two different methods, and their derivatives, gold-coated TSNPs (AuTSNPs), were investigated for use in refractive index sensitivity-based solution assays. Refractive index sensitivities of these nanoplates were determined and benchmarked against the theoretical calculation predicted by Miller et al.. The first generation TSNPs and AuTSNPs were used for the detection of human C-reactive protein (CRP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and the second generation AuTSNPs were used for the detection of human CRP. In order to address the complex assay design, a simpler aggregation-based assay for the detection of human IgG was implemented using spherical gold nanoparticles. Furthermore, a preliminary study on incorporating the AuTSNPs into a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor was carried out to explore the enhancement effect of the nanoplates on SPR detection. 
 
Nobel metal nanoparticles are found to enhance fluorescence-based biosensing due to a phenomenon known as metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) when the nanoparticles are in the vicinity of fluorophores. In this work, the enhancement effects of the AuTSNPs and spherical silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on the fluorescence were evaluated. A significant enhancement was observed for AgNPs whereas no enhancement was observed for AuTSNPs. Further MEF studies were conducted using various dyes and gold-coated AgNPs. AgNPs were used for enhancing the fluorescence-based assays for human IgG and CRP detection. The limits of detection (LODs) of the IgG and CRP assays were improved by ~ 9-fold and ~ 19-fold, respectively.

Masalah penelitian ini adalah apa saja nilai-nilai yang terkandung dalam naskah drama Tanah Perempuan karya Helvy Tiana Rosa. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mendeskripsikan nilai moral yang terdapat dalam karya Helvy Tiana Rosa pada naskah drama Tanah Perempuan. Sumber data penelitian ini adalah naskah drama Tanah Perempuan karya Helvy Tiana Rosa yang diterbitkan oleh LaPena pada tahun 2006. Naskah drama ini terdiri atas 9 babak dengan 122 halaman. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah metode deksriptif dengan pendekatan kualitatif. Teknik pengumpulan data yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah teknik dokumentasi. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa nilai moral yang terdapat dalam naskah drama Tanah Perempuan karya Helvy Tiana Rosa meliputi, (1) hubungan manusia dengan Tuhan, dinyatakan dengan para tokoh yang merasa lemah, tidak berdaya ketika bencana melanda dan para tokoh mempertanyakan pada Tuhan mereka, antartokoh juga saling mengingatkan untuk selalu berserah diri pada Tuhan, dan para tokoh yakin bahwa Tuhan yang Maha Adil akan menepati janji-Nya untuk orang-orang yang bersabar dan berserah diri pada-Nya ketika cobaan diberikan. (2) Hubungan manusia dengan diri sendiri, hadir pada para tokoh ketika mereka dihadapkan pada musibah. Maka tampaklah tokoh Mala yang tidak sadar akan hak yang harus dipenuhi kepada jasmani dan rohaninya sehingga pada satu waktu ia dipertemukan dengan tokoh-tokoh yang membimbing dan mengingatinya untuk kembali memenuhi tuntutan fitrahnya sebagai manusia. (3) Hubungan manusia dengan manusia lainnya dalam lingkup sosial dinyatakan oleh sikap antartokoh yang saling menolong, menyemangati, dan memberikan dorongan untuk bangkit melawan duka kepada para tokoh yang mengalami musibah. moral values plays (manuscript drama)",2022-02-08T16:52:09.896Z

Such historical preconditions also influenced the modern decision of Donbass population. The efforts initiated to dispute the choice resulted in military and political conflict and difficult social and economic situation. These present challenges as well as the implementation issues of future development strategies condition the need for analysis in demographic aspects of ethno-cultural environment formation in Donetsk Region It is established that labor migrations conducted under control of tsarist and further Soviet Government not only promoted the progress of Donbass industry but formed ethnic and cultural basis of the regional society. In various historical periods the inflow of Russian migrants, and their predominance in towns and industrial centers of Donbass conditioned the prevalence of the Russian language with culture and traditions in its ethno-cultural environment.

Although an adequate indoor thermal environment has been found to affect student learning, little is known about students’ perceptions of classroom heating and ventilation and impacts on learning. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore how students in accelerated medical technology courses perceived the environmental quality in their classrooms and discern whether these conditions affected overall gains in knowledge, persistence, and retention in their learning. Fourteen participants from 2 local community colleges were interviewed using purposeful sampling. Guided by Nicol and Humphrey’s adaptive heat model along with the theories of Maslow, Bandura, and Bronfenbrenner, the research questions centered on how students perceived the classroom environmental quality and its effects on their learning and well-being. Thematic analysis was used to reveal concerns about the operational state of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, their effect on classroom environmental quality and the student's ability to attend class. Interview responses indicated that positive indoor environmental conditions are essential to students’ learning.

Pembimbing: (I) Dr. Sentot Kusairi M.Si. (II) Dra. Hartatiek, M.Si. Kata Kunci :  modul pembelajaran fisika, suplemen digital,  gerak lurus, siswa SMA kelas X Salah satu komponen yang berperan penting pada keberhasilan belajar peserta didik adalah bahan ajar. Salah satu bahan ajar yang dinilai cukup efektif dalam pembelajaran adalah modul. Sejauh ini modul yang ada memiliki keterbatasan untuk menggambarkan fakta-fakta terkait dengan materi yang dijelaskan pada modul. Untuk memperoleh pemahaman terhadap fakta terkait materi, peserta didik perlu mengamatinya secara langsung. Namun, jika setiap materi berupa fakta pada modul/bahan ajar ini mensyaratkan harus melakukan pengamatan secara langsung maka hal ini akan membutuhkan dana, dan resiko keamanan bagi peserta didik. Selain itu, proses pembelajaran juga memiliki keterbatasan waktu. Oleh karena itu, penggunakan modul akan lebih efektif lagi dengan adanya suplemen digital. Suplemen digital yang dimaksudkan adalah berupa video berisi fakta-fakta yang mendukung pemahaman konsep dari materi pembelajaran pada modul. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mendiskripsikan pengembangan modul dan mengetahui kelayakan modul setelah divalidasi isi dan ujicoba terbatas Model penelitian dan pengembangan pada penelitian ini diadopsi dari I Wayan Santyasa. Penelitian ini dilakukan di SMA Negeri 1 Pagak. Uji coba produk pengembangan dilakukan melalui dua tahap, yaitu Uji Perseorangan dan Uji Kelompok Kecil. Tahap Uji Perseorangan sama dengan tahap validasi isi. Validator adalah 2 dosen fisika UM dan 1 guru fisika SMA Negeri 1 Pagak. Responden Uji Coba Terbatas (Uji Kelompok Kecil) terdiri dari 10 siswa SMA Negeri 1 Pagak yang pernah memperoleh materi gerak lurus. Jenis data yang diperoleh adalah data kuantitatif dan data kualitatif. Data kuantitatif berupa nilai rata-rata angka-angka hasil angket uji coba dari para validator. Data kualitatif berupa saran, kritik, dan tanggapan dari validator dan siswa. Instrumen dalam penelitian yang digunakan adalah angket penilaian kompenen-komponen modul.

All ETS procedures carried out at our institution from January 2009 until September 2011 were reviewed retrospectively. Patient demographics and operative details were recorded from patient notes. Radiographic evaluation involved the Barrack cementation grading system, Dorr9s criteria, stem alignment and leg length measurement. There was no significant difference in operative time between ETS performed by consultant or by specialty trainee. On postoperative x-ray, cement mantles were Barrack grade A or B in 55.6% (trainees) versus 61.9% (consultants). Stem alignment was neutral in 50% and varus in 50% of cases for trainees, versus 28.6% and 71.4% of cases for consultants. In total, 69.2 % of patients had lengthening of the operated limb with a mean increase of 10.4mm (2–25) for trainees and 9.3mm (2–18) for consultants. Both trainees and consultants can attain a good cement mantle. However, from our results stem alignment is less accurate by trainees with half being placed in varus. Our results highlight the difficulty of obtaining correct leg length positioning with the ETS with trainees and consultants having similar discrepancies. The ETS is a useful procedure for orthopaedic trainees to attain adequate skills in modern cementation techniques with similar post-operative radiographic outcomes to consultants.

The duration of the light at the end of a question, response, or other pause can be regulated to control wait time length. The effects of using the Wait Time was noted to be enhanced by a supportive intervention process that employed analyses of tape recordings of classroom discussions. Through studies, it has been determined that effective use of wait time can result in spontaneous improvements in both cognitive and affective variables in the classroom. These changes are greater if wait time information is supplemented by supportive intervention from persons who have studied tape recordings of interactions from the teachers' classrooms.

The macrocyclic structures contain two NH residues which greatly accelerate N-alkylation by activating the chloride leaving group. The chemical reaction increases fluorescence intensity by promoting excimer emission and attenuating the quenching induced by photoinduced electron transfer (PET). Although they are known to be toxic chemicals, chloroalkanes are produced in large amounts for various applications in modern society. For example, dichloromethane is widely used as a solvent for extraction and synthesis, and it is also a common component in paint strippers and removers. The homologue, 1,2-dichloroethane, is produced in much larger amounts primarily for use as a precursor monomer for poly(vinyl chloride). More reactive chloroalkanes are employed as pharmaceuticals, insecticides, and chemical warfare agents. Since many of these compounds have long residence times in the environment, there is a need to develop methods of detecting and scavenging them from contaminated air and water streams. This report describes a prototype fluorescent chemosensor that can detect certain types of chloroalkanes. The design is based on our recent discovery that amine macrocycle 1 attacks chloroalkanes with unusually high reactivity. For example, it reacts with dichloromethane solvent to form the quaternary ammonium salt 2 with a half-life of 2 min at room temperature (Scheme 1). This is about 50000 times faster than the analogous (1) (a) ClaysonD. B. Chemical Carcinogenesis; Little, Brown and Company: Boston, 1962; p 176. (b) Searle, C. E.

Similar rate accelerations have also been measured with other types of primary chloroalkanes and detailed mechanistic studies indicate that macrocycle 1 exhibits enzyme-like properties to accelerate the bimolecular alkylation reaction. Most importantly, the chloroalkane associates with the macrocycle to form a prereaction complex, which allows the two NH residues in the macrocyclic cavity to activate the chloride leaving group as the adjacent electrophilic carbon is attacked by the macrocyclic amine nitrogen. After reaction, the chloride leaving group remains strongly associated with the quaternary ammonium cation such that 2 is a contact ion pair. Furthermore, ion pair 2 has a tendency to form a cofacial aggregate in the solid state and in weakly polar solvents. Previous investigations of fluorescent sensors for haloalkanes have used fluorescent amines to react covalently and form ammonium salts. The reaction leads to an increase in fluorescence intensity because it decreases quenching by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the lone pair on the nucleophilic amine to the attached fluorophore. Herein, we describe the reactivity and fluorescence sensing properties of naphthalene containing macrocycles 3 and 4 (Scheme 2). The designs incorporate two identical naphthalene fluorophores within the macrocyclic scaffold of parent 1 in a way that does not change the number of atoms in the macrocyclic cavity. Thus, we expected to maintain the high chloroalkane reactivity due to activation by the two NH residues in the macrocyclic cavity, and also gain a fluorescent enhancement effect due to loss of PET quenching upon N-alkylation. The structural difference between 3 and 4 is the replacement of an electron-donating methylene unit attached to each naphthalene with a withdrawing carbonyl. As shown below, this leads to a significant change in the PET quenching response. We expected that the free base forms of 3 and 4 would exhibit low fluorescence due to PET quenching of the naphthalenes by the centrally located tertiary amine, and that fluorescent intensity would increase as the accelerated N-alkylation reaction occurs to give products 5 and 6. As discussed below, an additional sensing feature is the propensity of the ion-pair products to self-associate and form aggregates that exhibit excimer emission spectra. The synthesis of compounds 3 and 4 was achieved in straightforward fashion using methods that are described in the Supporting Information. Macrocycle 3 was obtained as single crystals, which allowed analysis by X-ray diffraction. As shown in Figure 1, the solid-state macrocyclic conformation closely matches that of parent 1 with the lone pair of the amine nitrogen pointing into the macrocyclic cavity and poised to attack an associated chloroalkane. Also shown is the unit cell packing of two cofacial macrocycles in a head to tail orientation with close overlap of the naphthalene units. The reactivity of macrocycles 3 and 4 was first evaluated by measuring rate constants in dichloromethane solvent. NMR studies showed that the reaction products 5 and 6 (R′ ) Cl) were obtained in quantitative yield, and pseudo-firstorder rate constants were measured using a previously described HPLC method. The second-order rate constant with 3 in dichloromethane was 2.9 × 10-4 M-1 s-1 at 25 °C, which corresponds to a half-life of about 1 min. This is approximately two times faster than the reaction of original macrocycle 1 with dichloromethane. The reaction of analogue 4 in dichloromethane is about 50 times slower with a secondorder rate constant of 6.3 × 10-6 M-1 s-1 and a half-life of almost 1 h. It appears that the presence of the two electronwithdrawing carbonyl groups in 4 decreases the nucleophilicity of its attacking nitrogen. (12) Stanger, K.; Lee, J,-J.; Smith, B. D J. Org.

Lett., Vol. 10, No. 9, 2008 Macrocycles 3 and 4 were subsequently evaluated for their abilities to sense the presence of dichloromethane in the inert solvent tert-butylmethyl ether. Figure 2 shows the change in fluorescence emission of 3 (10 μM) in tert-butylmethyl ether after addition of 2 mM of dichloromethane. Over 200 min, there was a modest enhancement of the monomer emission at 420 nm, presumably due to reaction induced inhibition of PET quenching, and a stronger enhancement of the excimer emission band at 520 nm. It appears that as the reaction progresses, the ion-pair product 5 (R′ ) Cl) aggregates in the weakly polar solvent. A more dramatic change in emission spectra was obtained when 3 was treated with the more reactive chloromethyl methyl ether, a representative carcinogenic alkylating agent. As expected, the N-alkylation reaction was much faster. For example, treatment of 3 (20 μM) with 1 molar equiv of chloromethyl methyl ether in tert-butylmethyl ether solvent leads to complete reaction after 10 min. Again, there is a modest increase in the monomer emission band at 420 nm, but now a much larger increase in the excimer band at 520 nm (Figure 3). Thus, compared to the previous reaction product 5 (R′ ) Cl), the propensity of product 5 (R′ ) OMe) to aggregate in weakly polar solvent is greater. Further evidence that the excimer band at 520 nm is due to product self-aggregation was gained from the following titration experiments. As shown in the top of Figure 4, the fluorescence emission of macrocycle 3 (10 μM) is slightly enhanced upon protonation by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (100 μM) which inhibits PET quenching. A subsequent additon of tetrabutylammonium chloride (10 μM) leads to aggregation of the 3·HCl ion pair and significant enhancement of the excimer emission band at 520 nm. Reversing the addition order produces the outcome shown in the bottom of Figure 4. As expected, adding tetrabutylammonium chloride to macrocycle 3 induces no change in fluorescence emission, (15) Even though Classociates with 3 in weakly polar solvent (see citation 24 in ref ",2022-02-13T11:11:40.542Z

Quality of life of patients with end-stage renal disease is impaired due to residual renal function, but also due to its therapeutic treatment (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis). Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the views of patients undergoing hemodialysis on the general concept of quality of life, the factors that affect the quality of an individual’s life and the dimensions that the patients themselves believe they have an impact on their quality of life. The self-reported quality of life and a number of psychological dimensions are also explored. Materials and Methods: In this qualitative study, which was held in April 2016, the views and beliefs of 12 patients about the quality of life were recorded and analyzed. Results: The sample consisted of six men and six women, ranging from 30 to 79 years old and the duration of dialysis program was among 0.5 to 15 years. The most important factors that affect the quality of individuals’ life, according to the views of dialysis patients, are health and psychology. This view was supported by nine out of twelve patients. Furthermore, eleven out of twelve patients believe that the primary factor affecting them is their nephropathy, with the concept of a serious chronic disease. The sociability, the dependence on health staff, as well as the dietary restrictions and issues regarding their occupation are other important factors affecting them. Anxiety and impaired psychology are also present, especially between patients who have recently joined into a dialysis program. Conclusions: The patients mentioned a more limited quality of life, showing a greater dissatisfaction to different aspects of their disease and their impact on their everyday lives. Specifically, they expressed increasing dissatisfaction about the time spent for the treatment of their disease, the dependence on the hemodialysis staff, the reduced ability to travel and their inability to work.

The original metrics we set up in CLIOPCI I (2) did work well; however, their refinement over time was a key process. Dr. Lee and colleagues suggest the application of a single criterion: the presence of an in-stent minimal lumen area (MLA) greater than the distal reference lumen area (3). We do appreciate their effort to standardize and simplify procedures, but we doubt that this is the solution to be pursued with imaging modalities for the following reasons. First, in the CLI-OPCI II study, the problems at the references were by far the most relevant, being related to a risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) that was 8.1 times higher than for control subjects (Figure 1B). The stent percentage of underexpansion suggested by Dr. Lee and colleagues (MLA <70% of reference lumen areas) would guarantee a much inferior clinical benefit. On the basis of our data, MACE were found in 22.7% of cases when absolute values were applied (in-stent MLA <4.5 mm) versus 19.5% of cases using the percentage of underexpansion. Furthermore, other IVUS studies (4) have indicated that the absolute MLA value is more efficient than the percentage of underexpansion in predicting the risk of cardiovascular events. Second, the approach we suggest is rather simple and fast, because readers can rely on the automated analysis shown in the lumen profile view (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minnesota) (Figure 1A). Based on the approach suggested by the CLI-OPCI II data (1), interventional cardiologists have to proceed with 2 simple steps: 1) make sure that the lumen area inside the stent and references is larger than 4.5 mm; and 2) exclude significant dissections with a width larger than 0.2 mm at the distal edge. Let’s use OCT for what it is worth rather than as an alternative for IVUS. Few things are better than a good friend, but for real fun, you need a few more.",2022-07-25T17:36:16.467Z

Weir Mitchell diagnosed Charlotte Perkins Gilman (then Stetson) as suffering from a variation of ""nervous prostration,"" or ""neurasthenia,"" as outlined in his Fat and Blood (1877), he prescribed what many nineteenth-century physicians (including Freud) believed to be the necessary recuperative regimen - rest. Included in Mitchell's Rest Cure treatment were locking Gilman away in his Philadelphia sanitarium for a month, enforcing strict isolation, limiting intellectual stimulation to two hours a day, and forbidding her to touch pen, pencil, or paintbrush ever again.(1) Mitchell believed, Catherine Golden tells us, that both companionship and work proved a detriment to his patient's recovery, further taxing her nerves already frazzled from an admixture of hysteria and postpartum depression (Golden, ""|Overwriting' ..."" 146). Gilman dramatized her experience with Dr. Mitchell in ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" (1892), a journalistic/clinical account of a woman's gradual descent into madness (or is she mad at the beginning and is pathologically reliving the descent that has already taken place?) at the hands of her husband John, a doctor who subscribes to the Mitchell treatment. Gilman's narrator is isolated ""three miles from the village"" (11) in an upstairs nursery of a ""colonial mansion"" (9), its windows barred and its walls covered in a faded yellow wallpaper whose ""sprawling flamboyant patterns"" commit ""every artistic sin"" (13) imaginable. It is a room whose wallpaper reduces an artistic and articulate woman to a beast, stripped entirely of her sanity and humanity and left crawling on all-fours in circuits, or smooches, about the room. For this reason, feminist critic Elaine Hedges wrote in 1973 that the ""paper symbolizes her situation as seen by the men who control her and hence her situation as seen by herself"" (Afterword 51), a view echoed by later critics. ""The Yellow Wallpaper,"" then, became a feminist text that indicted the men who were responsible for the narrator's physical confinement and subsequent mental demise. But this is also a room not unlike that described by Michel Foucault in Discipline and Punish (1975), patterned after Jeremy Bentham's eighteenth-century Panopticon. Originally designed to replace the dark and dank ""houses of security"" so common throughout England with the bright and salubrious ""house of certainty"" (Foucault 202), the Panopticon developed into an unscrupulous method of inquisition that perpetuated fear and bred paranoia. Like the room that confines Gilman's narrator, the Panopticon proved to be not a utopia for prisoners, mental patients, and schoolboys, but ""a cruel, ingenious cage"" (Foucault 205) that misjudged human reaction to unabated surveillance. Yet what Gilman critics for the most part have until recently) tended to neglect, and what this interpretation will stress, is that the narrator, despite her doctor's ill-advice and her husband's dehumanizing imprisonment, is successful in freeing herself from her male-imposed shackles, her Panopticon. Such a view supports the feminist label already attached to ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" but counters the premise upon which the arguments of Hedges and others are based: that she ""never does get free"" and, in fact, ""has been defeated"" in the end - in short, ""destroyed"" (Afterword 52-53, 55).(2) The benefits of the Panopticon over the prisons, factories, and psychiatric wards of his time, Bentham argued, were several. Its primary goal, though, was to generate a symbiotic relationship between the observer and the observed. In reversing ""the principle of the dungeon,"" the Panopticon, an instrument of power and observation, would provide the interned with a clean, well-lighted, and relatively pleasant environment, and the warden with the most efficient means of control through minimal effort (Foucault 200). Wheel-like in structure with a central tower at its hub and connecting cells, like spokes, protruding from its middle, ""the panoptic mechanism,"" Foucault writes, ""arranges spatial unities that make it possible to see constantly and to recognize immediately"" (200). …",2022-07-25T19:26:10.600Z

The article is devoted to the analysis of the functioning of Turkish translations of Shakespeare’s poetry and dramaturgy, the formation of a holistic picture of the stages of discovery of Shakespeare by the Turks. The aim of the study is to identify and present the main points related to the transfer of Shakespeare’s word into Turkish culture through translations from European languages. The proposed study is focused on translation aspects, as translation has become the first link in the dialogue between English and Turkish literature during the contact and interaction of Turkish literature with the Western, the processes of familiarization of the Shakespeare with the Turks, the perception and reproduction of Shakespeare’s creativity on Turkish soil. In this study we used such methods as the cultural-historical method, which focuses on the translation of Shakespeare’s works in relation to the cultural-historical development of Turkish society; a comparative method aimed at comparing the original sonnets and dramas of Shakespeare with translations into Turkish; receptive-aesthetic method, focused on focusing on how the pictorial and expressive artistic means of Shakespeare’s works in Turkish translations are projected on the recipient (reader), convey to him the author’s idea. Particular attention is focused on the translation analysis of some sonnets and dramas. Working with factual material revealed the basic prerequisites for entry into the Turkish literature of Shakespeare’s works (Divan literature, the period of reforms), made it possible to characterize the first stage of translation studies – namely, the translation of Shakespeare through the prism of the French language, and accordingly the translation from the French language. As a result, we conclude that no artistic translation, especially poetic one, can be definitive, since there are always unrealized reserves of the original hidden in the",2022-08-11T12:45:50.986Z

Then, its debris may form a precessing stream which may even collide with itself. In order to understand the dynamical e(cid:11)ects of the stream-stream collision on the eventual accretion of the stellar debris onto the black hole, we have studied how gas (cid:13)ow behaves when the outgoing stream collides supersonically with the incoming stream. We have investigated the problem analytically with one-dimensional plane-parallel streams and numerically with more realistic three-dimensional streams. A shock formed around the contact surface converts the bulk of the orbital streaming kinetic energy into thermal energy. In three-dimensional simulations, the accumulated hot post-shock gas then expands adiabatically and drives another shock into the low density ambient region. Through this expansion, thermal energy is converted back to the kinetic energy associated with the expanding motion. Thus, in the end, only a small fraction of the orbital kinetic energy is actually converted to the thermal energy, while most of it is transferred to the kinetic energy of the expanding gas. Nevertheless the collision is e(cid:11)ective in circularizing the debris orbit, because the shock e(cid:14)ciently transforms the ordered motion of the streams into the expanding motion in directions perpendicular to the streams. The circularization e(cid:14)ciency decreases, if two colliding streams have a large ratio of cross sections and a large density contrast. But even in such cases, the main shock extends beyond the overlapping contact surface and the high pressure region behind the shock keeps the stream of the larger cross section from passing freely. Thus the stream-stream collisions are still expected to circularize the stellar debris rather e(cid:14)ciently, unless the ratio of the cross sections is very large (i.e., (cid:27)1=(cid:27)2 (cid:29) 10).",2022-08-18T20:15:35.052Z

Studies were performed in fetuses with severe anemia and/or hydrops fetalis. Measurements were performed in fetal blood or amniotic fluid, obtained before or during intrauterine transfusion.

The severity of anemia can be predicted by measurement of bilirubin in amniotic fluid. We showed that this concentration is based on bilirubin in fetal blood and on albumin concentrations. Albumin in amniotic fluid is most probably not of fetal however of membrane or maternal origin. Thus, bilirubin seems to exchange between albumin in fetal blood and amniotic fluid over the intramembraneous pathway.

Low albumin concentration in fetal blood seems to be a secondary effect of hydrops fetalis. Fetuses with severe anemia were found to maintain their total blood volume. Thus, the decrease in red cell volume is compensated by an increase in plasma volume. This could explain the decrease in albumin concentration. During intrauterine transfusion, part of the plasma volume leaves the circulation. It is expected that this process continues after transfusion, thus further increasing the hematocrit.

In previous research the roles of situational valence and shared physical traits between the ethnic models and ethnic consumers have largely been ignored. This research was developed to first understand consumer preferences for ethnic models (operationalized as Black) representing in positively/negatively positioned brand personalities. Results indicate both White and Black respondents express preferences that would be deemed stereotypical, where more (less) Afrocentric models are preferred as representative of negatively (positively) positioned brand personalities. White respondents' reported preferences significantly more extreme than Blacks in both situations. Secondarily, this research uses ethnic consumers' self-reported Afrocentrism to understand preference deviations of Black consumer subgroups versus White consumers. On a subgroup level, some ethnic subgroups report preferences that are markedly more moderate and counterstereotypical, indicating a potential for marketers to be more liberal in the variety of ethnic models selected to represent brands.INTRODUCTIONHow do phenotypic traits (i.e., physical characteristics that distinguish an individual's ethnicity; Maddox, 2004) possessed by minorities in advertisements dictate how these individuals are perceived, and how do these perceptions drive preferences among a consuming populous? Operationalizing minorities as Blacks, Meyers (2011) provides an important initial look into these questions demonstrating Black models (i.e., Blacks hired to represent a brand in advertisements) are perceived differently by Black consumers based on the models' skin tone and the consumer's individual ethnic identity. Of significance, Meyers finds that high ethnic identifying consumers are more accepting than low ethnic identifiers of models in advertisements depicted with a ""darker"" skin tone. There are, however, additional questions that need to be investigated.When employing Black models as the centerpiece of brand communications ethnic stereotypes may affect how consumers perceive intended messaging. Phenotypicality bias (i.e., biases related to phenotypic traits) is one such stereotype that, all else equal, has led Blacks possessing more phenotypic traits (i.e., Afrocentric traits - darker skin, broader nose, thicker lips; Blair Judd, Saddler, & Jenkins, 2002) to be viewed negatively while conversely those possessing fewer phenotypic traits were thought of positively (see Maddox, 2004 for review). Adeptly used, managers can utilize societal perceptions about a model's phenotype to bolster a brand's existing personality (i.e., ""the set of human characteristics associated with a brand,"" Aaker 1997, p. 347) and to assist in framing a particular execution's message. Having a holistic understanding of phenotypic effects is important in marketing because as organizations employ Black models, consumers (minority1 and non-minority alike) may derive different messages from the imagery tied to models' appearances rather than the overarching execution content. Prior to generating executions, there must be an understanding of consumer preferences for specific phenotypic representations and the suitability of these images given a brand's personality, lest the intended message may not be properly delivered.Phenotypicality biases tied to minority groups have been documented in societies throughout the world and suggests that, among other traits, lighter skin is generally valued over darker skin (e.g., Arce, Murguia, & Frisbie, 1987; Harris, Consorte, Lang, & Byrne, 1993; Murguia & Telles, 1996; Uhlmann, Dasgupta, Elgueta, Greenwald, & Swanson, 2002). To illustrate, Kerr (2005) investigated the paper bag test where Blacks historically were granted enhanced social status and access within their community if their skin was lighter than a paper bag. …",2022-09-14T03:42:27.748Z

These concepts became popular among engineering community and were given in various engineering publications. However rigorous mathematical explanations these concepts turned out to be a challenging task, thus, in the 2nd edition of Gardner's well-known work, Phaselock Techniques, he wrote that ""despite its vague reality, lock-in range is a useful concept"" and posed the problem ""to define exactly any unique lock-in frequency"". In this paper an effective solution for Gardner's problem on the unique definition of the lock-in frequency and lock-in range is discussed. The lock-in range and lock-in frequency computation is explained on the example of classical second-order PLL with lead-lag and active proportional-integral filters. The obtained results can also be used for the lock-in range computation of such PLL-based circuits as two-phase PLL, two-phase Costas loop, BPSK Costas loop, and optical Costas loop, used in intersatellite communication.",2022-09-21T00:24:51.366Z

To model this, we assume that the set S of possible states of the world and the set X of possible outcomes each have a topological structure. The only feasible acts are continuous functions from S to X, and the only observable events are regular open subsets of S. In this environment, we axiomatically characterize a Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) representation of preferences over acts, involving a continuous utility function on X (unique up to positive affine transformations), and a unique probability measure on a Boolean algebra B of regular open subsets of S. With additional topological hypotheses, we obtain a unique Borel probability measure on S, along with an auxiliary apparatus called a liminal structure, which describes the agent’s informational constraints. We also obtain SEU representations involving subjective state spaces, such as the Stone-Cech compactification of S and the Stone space of B.",2022-09-26T22:49:25.055Z
